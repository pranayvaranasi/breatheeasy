# --- Modeling Configuration ---
modeling:
  # List of cities for which models will be trained and predictions generated.

    - Bangalore
    - Chennai
    - Hyderabad
    - Mumbai

  # Number of days to forecast ahead for the user interface.
  forecast_days: 3
  
  # Weather regressors to use in the Prophet model (available in Master_AQI_Dataset.csv)
  # Selected based on correlation with AQI and atmospheric science principles
  weather_regressors: 
    - temperature_2m
    - relative_humidity_2m
    - precipitation
    - pressure_msl
    - cloud_cover
    - wind_speed_10m
    - dew_point_2m
  
  # The maximum value for the initial live residual in the "Anchor and Trend" logic.
  # This prevents a single, massive error on day 0 from skewing the entire forecast.
  # A value of 75 means if the live AQI is 200 and the model predicts 100 (a 100-point error),
  # the system will cap the error at 75 when starting its forecast.
  max_residual_cap: 75
